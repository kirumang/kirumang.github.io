I am a Ph.D student and Research Assistant at TU Wien, [ACIN](https://www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/en/), [Vison for Robotics Group](https://www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/en/vision-for-robotics/). I have started my research related to vision for robotics at TU wien since Oct. 2016.

My research interest is:
- 6D pose estimation of objects
- Pose estimation of natural objects, deformable objects
- Robotic Manipulation and Grasping
- Bin-picking
- 3D Vision, RGB-D perception
- Object segmentation
- Object detection
- Object classification
