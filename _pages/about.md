#This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

This is Kiru Park's personal blog about his research.

I am a Ph.D student and Research Assistant at TU Wien, [ACIN](https://www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/en/), [Vison for Robotics Group](https://www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/en/vision-for-robotics/). I have started my research related to vision for robotics at TU wien since Oct. 2016.

My research interest is:
- 6D pose estimation of objects
- Pose estimation of natural objects, deformable objects
- Robotic Manipulation and Grasping
- Bin-picking
- 3D Vision, RGB-D perception
- Object segmentation
- Object detection
- Object classification
