Have you ever tried to dance with a robot?

Today, I want to introduce my small dancing robot, DanCat.

It has 2 DOF in head (Pitch and Yaw) and 1 DOF in tail
Its Head movement also effect on its leg (Funny!)

The robot is designed to move with respect to the rhythms in a music.
Sound signals from a music are passed by FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) to decompose signals into the frequency base.

Each modalities (2 head movement and 1 tail movement) are connected to particular frequency ranges. e.g. low frequency range is connected to tail movement with impact motion, mid frequency range is connected to speed of head's yaw movement with natural and continuous movement.

This robot is totally portable, which dances on everyone's shoulder.

Let's Play with the robot!
